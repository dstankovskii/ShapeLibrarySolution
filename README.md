# ShapeLibrary

**ShapeLibrary** is a library for working with geometric shapes. It allows you to calculate the area of shapes such as circles and triangles.

## Features

- Supports area calculation for shapes using the `IShape` interface.
- Includes classes for circle (`Circle`) and triangle (`Triangle`).
- Input validation for parameters (e.g., radius, triangle sides).
- Ability to check if a triangle is a right triangle.
- A universal method, `ShapeCalculator.CalculateArea`, allows for area calculation of any shape without knowing its type at compile-time.
